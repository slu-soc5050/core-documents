# Course User's Guide
## Preface
As outlined in the [syllabus](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf), the Course User's Guide is meant to be a companion document to the course designed to help students be successful not just in the course but in research more generally. I originally envisioned this as a `.pdf` file that would accompany the [syllabus](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) and the [reading list](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf). In working on it over the first couple of weeks, however, it has become clear that this is a document that is going to evolve over the course of the semester. I am therefore planning to publish it in sections directly to the `Core-Documents` [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents). This will better facilitate a 'living' document that can grow and develop over the course of the semester.
